# Three distinct outcomes, because conflating them is dangerous:
#   0 -> open
#   1 -> confirmed closed        (caller shuts the session down)
#   2 -> could not determine     (caller keeps running and retries)
#
# The previous version returned "closed" for API errors too, so an outage, an
# expired key, or a changed response shape silently ended the trading day.
#
# Shape-agnostic on purpose: FMP has served this payload both as a bare object
# and as a single-element array. Indexing with .[0] against an object makes jq
# fail with "Cannot index object with number", which the old code counted as
# "closed" -- meaning the check could never return true.
